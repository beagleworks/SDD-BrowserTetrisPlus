# Project Guide

## About the Project

We are developing a Tetris game that runs in the browser. There are additional rules to make the game more interesting.

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript
- Avoid using TypeScript classes as much as possible in coding
- Follow test-driven development using the methods recommended by t-wada
- Execute `git add . && git commit -m "(task title)"` after completing each subtask
- It is prohibited to modify tests to make them pass when tests are failing. If you have doubts about the validity of a test, please communicate that.
